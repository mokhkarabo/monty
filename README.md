0x19. C - Stacks, Queues - LIFO, FIFO

a programming project to stacks and queues in the C programming language and using global variables in a controlled manner.

In this project, I am tasked with implementing and understanding Last In, First Out (LIFO) and First In, First Out (FIFO) principles in the context of stacks and queues. I need to comprehend when to use stacks and queues, explore their common implementations and use cases, and grasp the proper utilization of global variables in C. Following specific coding requirements, including using allowed editors, compilation with designated options, adherence to the Betty style, and limiting global variables to one, is essential. Additionally, I must create a header file named monty.h with function prototypes and ensure proper documentation in a README.md file at the root of the project folder. Utilizing the provided data structures (stack_t and instruction_t) is mandatory. Finally, I need to compile the code with specified options, output results to stdout and errors to stderr, and establish a GitHub repository for the project while avoiding plagiarism and ensuring independent problem-solving.
